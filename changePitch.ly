\version "2.24.0"

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% version Y/M/D = 2022/12/16 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% LSR =  http://lsr.di.unimi.it/LSR/Item?id=654
%% Last release here:
%%   http://gillesth.free.fr/Lilypond/changePitch/
%% This directory contains also a doc called: changePitch-doc.pdf
%% Last changes (the more recent to the top) :
%%    - \relative in lilypond has changed internally. The lines in copy-dur+arti
%%      that used to manage the relative mode are no longer required. They are deleted.
%%    - combine copy-duration and copy-arti into 1 function: copy-dur+arti
%%    - function check-for-ties has been redone.
%%    - allows \displayLilyMusic to work, using reduce-seq in a music with a \tempo command
%%    - correction in \samePitch : music can contain no-pitch notes => call expand-notes-and-chords
%%    - new changPitch-doc.pdf (made with Context => http://wiki.contextgarden.net/ )
%%    - changePitch checks now, in his pattern arguments, if there is notes with ties,
%%      and automatically groups them with the tieded note in a \samePitch section.
%%      It is possible to desactivate this behaviour, for pieces made with previous
%%      release of changePitch. See doc...
%%    - \tuplet in lilypond 2.18 have now a 'duration property ! It is no more
%% 	    reserved for notes and rests  => we have to change some pieces of
%%      code in change-pitch function.
%%    - \changePitch : a single s as the last event of newnotes parameter
%%      will give you the ending rests of the pattern (if there), and two s
%%      also the beginning ones. If pattern ends with a note, a single
%%      ending s will have no effects.
%%    - changePitch.ly is now \language independant (no more #{ c #})
%%    - new algorithm for make-notes-list, change-pitch
%%      and has-notes? (shorter and safer)
%%
